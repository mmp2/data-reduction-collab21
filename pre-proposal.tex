{\bf Objective}: \gmani, a non-linear dimension reduction toolbox
in python, that scales to data matrices of order $n\times p \sim
10^{12}$, by vertically incorporating the state of the art in the mathematics and statistics of high dimensional geometric learning, and specifically in fast approximate {\em near neighbor (NN)} search.

\textbf{Motivation} Data in the form of
high-dimensional ``point clouds'', \comment{such as spectra of galaxies \comment{(with
dimension given by the number of spectral wavelengths)}, spatial
locations of the atoms in a molecule \comment{(with dimension given by the number atoms $\times$ spatial dimension 2 or 3)}, the state space of a dynamical system, as well as data for which a {\em distance} between observations can
be calculated, such as biological sequences, words and phrases, job
descriptions, images. } as exemplified in the figures above, is ubiquitous.
%
Often, the physical processes underlying these observations have
fewer degrees of freedom than the data dimension, and they can be
modeled by {\em manifolds} and vector fields thereon, achieving
significant data reduction, as well as noise removal and better understanding of the intrinsic degrees of freedom of the system. This class
of methods is known as (non-linear) {\em  embedding} methods.

\comment{ Embeddings know-how is relevant other data reduction in approaches too. One is smoothing the data, by projecting it onto a local manifold; the other is subsampling the regions where the data is too dense, and summarizing the local geometry by means of indexing, meta-information, or core-sets.}

\comment{Data reduction for the sciences must come with guarantees of
  reproducibility (e.g. outputs not sensitive to initialization of
  algorithm), stability (outputs not sensitive to variations in
  sample), as well as with rigurous methods to quantify the loss of
  information and the variability of the result, and with
  guarantees of preserving desired properties/features/(geometric)
  characteristics}

\textbf{Challenges} Estimating non-linear geometry is hard in statistical and mathematical terms. This is why na{i}ve embeddings, not grounded in theory, are {\em biased}, introducing distortions, or even {\em inconsistent}, tending to unreasonable/degenerate limits when $n\rightarrow \infty$. The statistical methods needed to analyze the properties of embedding algorithms and to design consistent, unbiased, ones are being developed. For example, \cite{2013arXiv1305.7255P} introduce a method based on Riemannian geometric concepts to calculate and to correct distortions in embeddings (see Figure). This method guarantees that the low dimensional embedding is isometric (preserves the intrinsic geometry) of the original, and can also detect degeneracies. 
However, (1) existing theory is too technical to be accesible to most scientists and engineers; (2) the theorems depend on unspecified constants and on properties of the data. To bring them to be relevant to science {\em one must develop methods to measure and test} if the theoretical conditions hold. One must also select those theoretical results that relie on testable assumptions, and that best fit the statistical structure of the problem. \comment{For example, the embedding algorithms must adapt to  the density of molecular configurations in state space can vary exponentially, or to the variation of measurements noise with red-shift and wavelength in spectrographic observations of galaxies, and exploit these properties, whenever possible.}

(3) Further scaling up embedding algorithms by a factor of 1000 or more, depends on accelerating {\em approximate} NN search. The first methodological focus of this work is ensuring that statistical guarantees for embedding algorithms still hold when approximate NN is used. The second is to translate these guarantees into uncertainty quantific


\textbf{What we will do}
 {\em Methods} for approximate near neighbor search, data indexing and subsampling, statistically suitable for non-linear embedding. The methods will be grounded in state of the art statistical and CS theory, and will come with error estimates, noise and information loss measures, and diagnosis methods (e.g. for degeneracy).\\
{\em Theory}  Original research on how to measure/test from data when theoretical conditions apply; to choose the optimal embedding method for a particular data, to derive what guarantees can be obtained from theory for the reduction of a real data set.
 \\
{\em Specific sciences} have specific data statistitics (e.g. variations in data density, noise properties). We will focus the generic data reduction methods above on data properties relevant to astronomy, astrophyisics, chemistry, and bio-engineering.\\
{\em Software} Release of a suite of python packages implementing the above methods, and specializing them for \mmp{fill in specific tasks} in \mmp{astrononomy, chemistry}. This will be based on the existing \mmani~methodology, completed with the implementation of the above results.
\comment{ (3) Computationally, finding neighbors of a point in high dimensions is the bottleneck, and approximate methods must be proved to not compromise the consistency of the embedding algorithm.
These are the barriers to the adoption of the state of the art knowledge in data embedding,  and herein lies our main contribution. }

\underline{\bf Team expertise} %Team of exceptional depth and breadth.
PI Meila is uniquely situated to successfully carry out this work. She is fluent in the statistical and theoretical CS advances, and can critically judge their relevance. She has a 10 year long track record of addressing critical geometric learning problems by novel methods grounded in theory \citep{2013arXiv1305.7255P,}. Her group maintains \mmani, capable of applying these to millions of data points, and has collaborations with ALCF and Sppexa (German Exa Scale Computing Consortium) to expand these to HPC environments.
